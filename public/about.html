<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Nick and I'm a 38-year-old web developer. I'm passionate about designing and developing
  websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love bringing sites to life and making them stand out. When I'm not
  coding, I'm usually spending time with my two adorable little girls. I'm always excited to connect with other
  like-minded web enthusiasts and would love to chat with you!</p>
