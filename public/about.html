<body>
  <p>Hello,

    I'm Nick Zuras, a 38-year-old web developer with a passion for crafting seamless digital experiences using HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript. Beyond coding, I find joy in spending time with my two little girls.</p>

  <p>In my digital playground, I specialize in turning lines of code into visually stunning interfaces, dedicated to
    making the web a better place. When not immersed in coding, you'll find me cruising on my motorcycle or rocking out
    to heavy metal riffs.</p>

  <p>If you share a passion for web development, bikes, or killer guitar solos, I'd love to connect. Let's make the
    digital world a bit more badass together!</p>

  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Nick Zuras ðŸš€ðŸ¤˜ #CodeEnthusiast #WebDevWizard #MetalheadOnTheWeb</p>
