    <ol>
        <li>Shaun Of The Dead</li>
        <li>Hot Fuzz</li>
        <li>The Worlds End</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(Not Part of The Trillogy) but I'm throwing Paul in for good measure as well</h4>
    <p>The entire Trillogy is hilarous Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing actors and writers. Paul is
        one of those movies I can never pass up if I see it on, we'll call it an added bonus!</p>
